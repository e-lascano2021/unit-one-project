## Let's Get Started!


### How to Play

Before we rush into the game there are a few things we need to go over:

1. Players should decide whether to play as Pink or Green for their token.
2. The Player to choose Pink will place their token on the board first.
   1. Once placed the tokens will fall to the bottom of the board
3. From there each Player will take turns stacking their tokens on the board
4. The first player to get four or more of their tokens in a row is the winner!
